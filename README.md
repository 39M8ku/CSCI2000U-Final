Introduction:
This dataset is about Apartment Building Standards and Apartment Building Standards is a bylaw enforcement program established in 2017 to ensure that owners and operators of apartment buildings with three or more storeys or 10 or more units comply with building maintenance standards.
By the laws, building must undergo evaluation at least once every three years. During evaluations, Bylaw Enforcement Officers inspect common areas, mechanical and security systems, parking and exterior grounds. Each item is inspected and assigned a score from one to five, with one being the lowest and five being the highest.
All these building is divided into the 25-ward system. In this report we will look at the different score of these building in each ward. We will see which ward is suffer from the worst scoring and what cause that. And this will help us and you to have to a better look in the city we currently live in.
 
Discussion:
First, we will need to what this dataset is showing, from the first few apartments of this list this dataset is showing the score of each different criteria that the apartments have in the GTA. From these data we obtained we can look at something like which ward’s suffer from the worst scoring apartments. To do this let’s look at some lowest score apartment and see what we find.
We found 1 building that has a score of 0, and if we take a closer, we found out that none of the score categories is give a score for this building. Which means a 0-score apartment will lower the average score of this ward by a lot, therefore we should drop this one in order to give a fair look compared to the other ward.
Then let’s group these scores by each ward, and see which ward have the lowest mean score. Then we will graph it to help us better visualize it. And from the data and graph we can see that Davenport have the lowest average score of 68.45 and the mean of all the apartment is 72.26. Then lets how many apartments are below average mean. We can see that 4788/9632, about half of apartments are below the average, which means that the data is balance. And Davenport has 238 apartments being evaluated. Davenport does have the worst average scoring apartments. But how many low score apartments are in this ward, we want to know is because there are few apartments with very low score that cause the average low, or because Davenport have a lot of low score apartment. Let’s use the 25% percentiles (score below 65) to see which ward has the lowest score apartment. Surprisingly Davenport only have 96 apartments that is below the 25% percentile, which means Davenport is actually not as bad as what we were think of, it actually has more apartment that is with higher score. In the other hand, we see that York South-Weston have 248, the most apartments that is below the 25% percentile.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, we know what Davenport has the lowest average score out of the 25 wards in this dataset. But does this mean Davenport is the ward that suffers from the worst scoring. If we look deep into it, there are 9632 apartments being evaluated, and Davenport only have 238 being evaluated. Which is only a small amount in the GTA, and less than half of the apartments in Davenport is below the average. But then we found out that York South-Weston has 248 apartments that is below the 25% percentile score, which is already more the total amount of apartments in Davenport. Therefore we can conclude that despite Davenport is the ward with worst score, there are other ward that has more worst score apartment than it.
